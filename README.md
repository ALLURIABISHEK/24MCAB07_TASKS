# Day- 03 Report

#Task that was given
=========================================================================================
Create a Java application that manages student enrollments in courses using MongoDB. Use 
embedded documents for some data and referenced documents for others, to understand their 
structural differences. Upload the code to GitHub with the name Day3-Task 
** Requirements 
MongoDB Collections 
students — stores student details 
courses — stores course details 
enrollments — stores enrollment records 
**Document Structure 
In enrollments: 
One document should embed both      
student and course data. 
Another should reference them using  
ObjectIds. 
To do:  
1. Insert sample students and courses. 
2. Add two types of enrollments (embedded and referenced). 
3. Query and print both types with full details. 
4. Update a student's name and mention the difference between updating a referenced 
document compared to embedded. 
5. Create indexes for querying the students 
6. Share the screenshot of the result in the readme file.
